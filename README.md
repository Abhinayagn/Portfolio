## About

Hi, I’m Abhinaya Gundagal Nagabhushan, a Data Analyst with a Master’s degree in Business Analytics from the University of New Haven.

I have hands-on experience analyzing customer, behavioral, and transactional data through academic projects and industry internships. My work involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, statistical analysis, and insight generation using Python, R, SQL, and visualization tools.

Through projects and internships, I have worked on user behavior analysis, job market data extraction, and customer analytics use cases. I am particularly interested in roles that involve translating data into actionable business insights and supporting data-driven decision-making.

This repository showcases my analytical approach, project work, and ability to communicate results in a clear, business-focused manner.
