Title: Job-Market-Web-Scraping

Goal:  
To collect and analyze real-time job postings from company career pages in order to understand current hiring trends, role demand, and location patterns for Data Analyst and Business Analyst positions, supporting data-driven career and market insights.

Description:  
The project focused on scraping real-world job postings directly from company career pages powered by Greenhouse application systems. The objective was to avoid outdated or duplicate listings commonly found on job boards and instead extract structured job data directly from employer sources.  

The dataset included job attributes such as job title, company name, location, and posting details. The project involved identifying Greenhouse-based job pages, extracting embedded JSON data, handling dynamic content using browser automation, cleaning and structuring the data, and storing the results in CSV format. Analyst-specific roles were further filtered to enable focused job market analysis.

Results:  
The analysis successfully identified real and active job postings directly from employer career systems, reducing noise from expired or duplicate listings. Clear patterns in analyst role availability and geographic distribution were observed, enabling a better understanding of current hiring demand. The extracted insights can be used for targeted job searches, workforce planning, and market trend analysis.
