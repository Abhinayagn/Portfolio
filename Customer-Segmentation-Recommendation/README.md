Title:Customer-Segmentation-Recommendation

Goal:
To analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns in order to identify meaningful customer segments and uncover product recommendation opportunities that support targeted marketing and improved customer retention.

Description:
The project focused on analyzing customer demographic, behavioral, and transactional data for a retail business scenario (Acme Innovations). The dataset included customer attributes such as age, salary, spending score, and customer tenure, along with historical purchase transaction data. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), segmenting customers using K-Means clustering, and applying association rule mining to identify frequently purchased product combinations for recommendation analysis.

Skills:
data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, clustering, association rule mining, data visualization, business insight generation.

Technology:
R, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, cluster, arules, arulesViz, scatterplot3d.

Results:
The analysis identified distinct customer segments with different spending behaviors and value levels. High-spending customer segments demonstrated strong retention potential, while association rule mining revealed frequently co-purchased product combinations that can be leveraged for product bundling, cross-selling, and personalized marketing strategies to improve customer retention and average order value.
